Notes For Project:

Do Not Use gesture data of G5, it is too similar to G4

TODO:
Collect Gyro data
Get non designed gestures and mark as undetermined
Gather data at different times of day to prevent memory
Tell Insight: 
- Vary through day,
- user specific,
- scenarios considered,
- scope instead of numbers
- focus on fundamental
- 3 gestures, but arent recognized by daily actions
- train user data individually
- look at a systems perspective, if you are the user, how do you accept this as valiable
